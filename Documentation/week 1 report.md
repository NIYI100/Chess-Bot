# Weekly Report 

## What did I do this week?
The most time I used for understanding the course and asking questions as I am an english speaker
and wasn't able to understand the first lecture.

After familiarizing with Moodle and the structure of the course I looked into the t´different
projects that were recommended. In detail, I especially looked into the "neural network - MNIST" task,
 the "k-nn - MNIST", the "Eigenfaces" task and the task to create an own chess engine.

After further thinking I decided that I want to do implement my own chess engine.
For that I did research on the algorithms and data structures I should use and did familiarize myself with them.
I look specifically into different board representations and MiniMax with alpha-beta pruning and some optimizations.

## How has the project progressed?
I did my GitHub Setup, my weekly report and the project specification. Furthermore, I thought about a structure
for my project.

## What did I learn this week?
I learned about the FEN, a way to represent a board of chess as an ASCII string. Furthermore, I learned about
some optimization techniques for MiniMax with alpha-beta pruning.

## What has been unclear or problematic?
I had two problems:
* It was quite hard for me to get every relevant information in english as some information were missing
and I had to translate them from finnish. But the translation was sometime different from the english text so
it wasn't very clear for me, what exactly I had to do.
* I had some problems regarding the time and space complexity in o notation of my project as I found it hard to
think about the variables that are relevant for me.

## What are my next steps?
I´ll start with the basics of the engine. Especially values for different pieces, first evaluation
function and so on.

## Weekly hours
* Research for the course: 6h
* Setup of project, writing: 3h
