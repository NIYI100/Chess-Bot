# Weekly Report 

## What did I do this week?
I worked on the castling rules as well as implementing a method of checking if the king is in check.
Furthermore I worked on the uci interface and made the game finally run in a uci GUI (In the moment Arena, not Lichess).
In addition to that I started working on the correction of the Transposition table and the implementation of move ordering
depending on the transposition table.

## How has the project progressed?
I implemented castling rigths, I fixed the errors with the uci interface, I updated the transposition tables.

## What did I learn this week?
As I only did fix some things or implement some "basic" functions I didnt learn anything really new.


## What has been unclear or problematic?
The transposition table still does have some problems and is much more complicaed to implement then I thought.
Furthermore, I now have some problems with a very complicated structure, that happened because of some errors in the planing
(Things I oversaw). Normally I would now do a refactoring to clean up the project but as there is not unlimited time
Ill have to ignore that for now.

## What are my next steps?
As Im not in Helsinki the next week, I will not be able to do much on the project.
The next plans are ton still finish the rules and the transposition table / move ordering.
