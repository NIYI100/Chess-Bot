# Weekly Report 

## What did I do this week?
I still worked on the implementation of the rules. In detail, I implemented castling rights / the check if castling is
possible and legal and then also include it into the legal_moves.
Furthermore, I implemented the fullmove / halfmove count so that games can end if the game exceeds 50 halfmoves.

In addition to that I read the peer review and started on the unit tests as well as the Readme. The later one is
finished and should include a full comprehension of the project as well as how to use the engine.

## How has the project progressed?
I implemented castling, fullmoves and halfmoves, as well as a comprehensive readme and first unittests.

## What did I learn this week?
I learned about unittests in python this week as well as more about the Markdown format.


## What has been unclear or problematic?
I know that Unittests are quite important, as they guarantee that the methods do what they should (at least if there
is enough code coverage and the unittest are well-structured). My problem with writing them at the moment is, that the
structure of the project is changing alot (as I described in the last weekly report -> Mistakes in the planing). Due to
that the unittesting isn't that easy (also because some features are still missing).

## What are my next steps?
I'm working on finishing the rules so that I can implemtent comprensive unittesting.
