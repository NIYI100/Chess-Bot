# Weekly Report 

## What did I do this week?
I worked on the implementation of the transposition table this week as well as the uci interface. As I had a fever i wasnt able to
do that much and I didn't progress as far as I wanted to.

## How has the project progressed?
The project has advanced in the regard that I implemented the transposition table and tested the uci interface.
The interface works in the local terminal but seems to have problems when plugged into the lichess gui.

## What did I learn this week?
I learned alot about the transposition table and what should be included. Also I learned a lot about ZobristKeys and
how to create or manage them.


## What has been unclear or problematic?
The Lichess gui doesn't seem to work with my engine and I still have to figure out what the reason for that is.
Also, there are still some errors in the transposition table which have to be fixed. Generally the implementation of the
transposition table was quite complicated as it is a very theoretical construct and not intuitive where the entries have
to be created, manged, etc.


## What are my next steps?
In the next week I want to finish the rules (castling / enPassant, counting of turns) so that I can focus on improving the algorithm
